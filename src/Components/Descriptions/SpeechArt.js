    <h3>How do we teach our children the art of public speaking?</h3>
    <br/>
    <ol>
        <li>Choosing a suitable topic for the child shows enthusiasm and prepare the delivery material together</li>
        <li>Support the topic by means of child labor</li>
        <li>Reciting in front of a mirror</li>
        <li>Training to move a vision from one person to another and avoid focusing on a particular person</li>
        <li>Training him to express some words with movements</li>
        <li>Buy him a microphone to live his world</li>
        <li>Make for him an audience of positive, optimistic people and relatives</li>
        <li>It is not important to mastery because the important thing is to enhance confidence</li>
    </ol>
