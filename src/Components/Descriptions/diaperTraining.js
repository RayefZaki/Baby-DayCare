    <h4>Three days method</h4>
    <p>The three-day method requires that you forgo your normal three-day schedule to focus entirely on potty training your child. You will spend the three days right next to your child, while learning to pay attention to all the signs he might need to use the toilet. Underwear is replaced with diapers at the beginning of the three days, so you can expect to experience many times when your child suddenly urinates, during training time.</p>

        <h4>time based method</h4>
        <p>To use this method, have your child sit on the toilet for at least a few minutes every hour or two, to begin with
From the time you wake up until the time you go to sleep. You can forgo the nappies or use the training pants, which can be discarded directly if the child pees in them</p>
